        <h2>Terminating crayons</h2>

            <p2>
                <strong>1971-1973</strong> : Under my teaching as a kindergarden teacher, 
                I developed a love for robots. I am a big admirer of <em>Iron Man</em> 
                from the comics, and learned to make robot by my father. The robot in the picture 
                creates crayons in any possible shape. The crayons pops out from 
                the red, glowing eyes and it can up to two crayons per second. 

                <p>
                The robot is now under the care of the kindergarden I was working for.

            <p3>
                <strong>2020-2021</strong>: My current project and new passion is knitting or crochet.
                My most proud achievement is the sweather I knitted by my own
                hands. The sweather is 100% organic cashmere.

                <p>
                This new hobby started under COVID where I lived together with my grandmother. 
                She was the owner of the yarn shop in the town where we lived and I was
                helping her taking care of her business. She taught me how to knitt 
                different techniques: magic-loop, edgh stitch and moss stitch.
